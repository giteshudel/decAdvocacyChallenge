## The Business Problem 🎯

Patrick runs a network of 5 auto repair shops. He's been tracking productivity data (number of cars fixed per day) across all shops, along with whether he (the boss) was present at each shop on each day. 


::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 The Key Insight: Data-Driven Decision Making

**The problem:** Patrick needs to make scheduling decisions based on data, not intuition. He needs to understand:

- Which shops benefit most from his presence?
- Are there patterns by shop that suggest different strategies?
- What are the revenue and profit implications of different scheduling scenarios?
- How confident can he be in these recommendations?

**Why this matters:** Poor scheduling decisions can lead to:

- Wasted time (Patrick at shops that don't need him)
- Lost revenue (shops that need him but don't get him)

**The connection:** This is a real-world decision problem where data analysis can directly impact business outcomes. Your job is to make the data tell a clear, actionable story.
:::

## The Data 📊

The dataset contains 250 observations of daily productivity across 5 shops:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
carsDF = pd.read_csv("carsFixed.csv")
```

```{python}
#| label: tbl-data-overview
#| tbl-cap: "Overview of the productivity data"
#| echo: false
carsDF.head(10)
```

**Data Dictionary:**

- `observation`: Observation number (1-250)
- `shopID`: Shop identifier (1-5)
- `boss`: Binary indicator (0 = boss absent, 1 = boss present)
- `carsFixed`: Number of cars fixed that day

```{python}
#| label: tbl-data-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics by shop and boss presence"
#| echo: false
summary = carsDF.groupby(['shopID', 'boss'])['carsFixed'].agg(['count', 'mean', 'std', 'min', 'max']).round(2)
summary
```

## Analysis: What Does the Data Show? 📈

### Visualizing All 250 Data Points

Let's visualize all 250 observations to see how productivity varies by shop and whether Patrick (the boss) was present:

```{python}
#| label: fig-all-data-points
#| fig-cap: "All 250 data points showing daily productivity by shop and boss presence. Each point represents one day. Points are jittered horizontally to reduce overlap."
#| echo: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# Set style
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
#plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12, 6)
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (8, 6)

# Create figure
#fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 7))
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 7))

# Prepare data for plotting
carsDF['boss_label'] = carsDF['boss'].map({0: 'Boss Absent', 1: 'Boss Present'})
carsDF['shop_label'] = 'Shop ' + carsDF['shopID'].astype(str)

# Create strip plot with jitter to show all points
sns.stripplot(
    data=carsDF,
    x='shop_label',
    y='carsFixed',
    hue='boss_label',
    dodge=True,
    alpha=0.6,
    size=4,
    jitter=0.3,
    ax=ax,
    palette={'Boss Absent': '#d62728', 'Boss Present': '#2ca02c'}
)

ax.set_xlabel('Shop', fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_ylabel('Cars Fixed per Day', fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_title('Productivity by Shop and Boss Presence: All 250 Days of Data', 
             fontsize=14, fontweight='bold', pad=20)
ax.legend(title='Boss Status', title_fontsize=11, fontsize=10, loc='upper left')
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Which Shops Benefit Most from Patrick's Presence?

Let's calculate the difference in average productivity when Patrick is present vs. absent for each shop:

```{python}
#| label: tbl-boss-impact
#| tbl-cap: "Impact of boss presence on productivity by shop"
#| echo: false
# Calculate mean productivity by shop and boss presence
impact = carsDF.groupby(['shopID', 'boss'])['carsFixed'].mean().unstack()
impact.columns = ['Boss_Absent', 'Boss_Present']
impact['Difference'] = impact['Boss_Present'] - impact['Boss_Absent']
impact['Percent_Change'] = (impact['Difference'] / impact['Boss_Absent'] * 100).round(1)
impact = impact.round(2)
impact.index.name = 'Shop'
impact = impact.reset_index()
impact.columns = ['Shop', 'Avg When Boss Absent', 'Avg When Boss Present', 
                  'Difference (Cars/Day)', 'Percent Change (%)']
impact = impact.sort_values('Difference (Cars/Day)', ascending=False)
impact
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-boss-impact
#| fig-cap: "Average productivity difference when boss is present vs. absent. Positive values mean the shop benefits from Patrick's presence."
#| echo: false
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))
# Calculate differences
shop_impact = carsDF.groupby(['shopID', 'boss'])['carsFixed'].mean().unstack()
shop_impact['Difference'] = shop_impact[1] - shop_impact[0]
shop_impact = shop_impact.sort_values('Difference', ascending=True)

# Create bar plot
colors = ['#2ca02c' if x > 0 else '#d62728' for x in shop_impact['Difference']]
bars = ax.barh(range(1, 6), shop_impact['Difference'], color=colors, alpha=0.7, edgecolor='black', linewidth=1.5)

# Add value labels
for i, (shop, diff) in enumerate(zip(shop_impact.index, shop_impact['Difference'])):
    ax.text(diff + (0.5 if diff > 0 else -0.5), i+1, 
           f'{diff:+.1f} cars/day', 
           va='center', ha='left' if diff > 0 else 'right',
           fontweight='bold', fontsize=10)

ax.axvline(0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)
ax.set_yticks(range(1, 6))
ax.set_yticklabels([f'Shop {i}' for i in shop_impact.index])
ax.set_xlabel('Difference in Average Cars Fixed per Day\n(Boss Present - Boss Absent)', 
             fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_title('Which Shops Benefit Most from Patrick\'s Presence?', 
             fontsize=14, fontweight='bold', pad=20)
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3, axis='x')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Key Findings:**

```{python}
#| echo: false
# Identify which shops benefit most
impact_analysis = carsDF.groupby(['shopID', 'boss'])['carsFixed'].mean().unstack()
impact_analysis['Difference'] = impact_analysis[1] - impact_analysis[0]
impact_analysis = impact_analysis.sort_values('Difference', ascending=False)

most_benefit = impact_analysis.index[0]
least_benefit = impact_analysis.index[-1]
most_benefit_diff = impact_analysis.loc[most_benefit, 'Difference']
least_benefit_diff = impact_analysis.loc[least_benefit, 'Difference']

# Display findings
from IPython.display import Markdown
findings_text = f"""
Based on the analysis above:

- **Shop {most_benefit} benefits MOST** from Patrick's presence: **+{most_benefit_diff:.1f} cars/day** on average when Patrick is present
- **Shop {least_benefit} benefits LEAST** (or may be hurt) by Patrick's presence: **{least_benefit_diff:.1f} cars/day** difference

The table and chart above show the complete picture for all 5 shops.

### What Your Report Should Include

Your report should answer these questions in a clear, concise way:

1. **What does the data show?**

   - Visualize all 250 data points showing productivity by shop and boss presence
   - Which shops benefit most from Patrick's presence? Which don't?

2. **What should Patrick do?**

   - Clear, specific recommendations: Which shops should he prioritize? Why?
   - What's the potential financial impact? (Revenue or profit implications)

3. **How confident can Patrick be?**

   - Explain uncertainty in plain terms an auto-mechanic can understand
   - What ranges of differences can he expect? (We only have 250 days—that's not a huge sample)
   - What could go wrong? What assumptions are you making?

4. **What does the future look like?**

   - Show at least one visualization of projected outcomes under different scheduling scenarios
   - Help Patrick see the potential impact of following your recommendations

**Remember:** Less is more. A focused, punchy report that Patrick can understand and act on is better than a long, complex analysis that confuses him.


##

The analysis report is based on 250 observations of daily productivity across 5 auto repair shops network owned by Patrick.


- Patrick can only be at one shop per day
- Different shops may respond differently to his presence
- Revenue depends on number of cars fixed (assume a fixed price per car)
- Historical patterns may not predict future performance perfectly
- Patrick loves visiting his brother who runs Shop 3
